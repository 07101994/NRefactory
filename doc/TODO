TypeSystem API:
* ITypeReference extends IFreezable?
	either:
	- make sure all ITypeReference implementations correctly freeze their contained types
	or:
	- remove IFreezable from type references

* For clarity: move all ITypeReference members except for Resolve() to IType?

* Decide on the fate of ISupportsInterning

* Try to build SharedTypes for void, int, etc.
	Take care of equality with the real System.Void, System.Int32 etc.
